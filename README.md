# GNS530 Replica for Microsoft Flight Simulator

This is a custom-built GNS530 panel replica designed to interface with **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (MSFS)** using **MobiFlight**. The system connects a physical interface to the simulator via an **Arduino Nano**, offering a realistic and immersive GPS experience for general aviation enthusiasts.

> 🚧 **This project is a work in progress.** Final assembly, wiring, and MobiFlight configuration are still being refined.
